The beauty of interactive data visualization is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program. You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. The following resources are some that I have used personally, that I highly recommend, for anyone looking to learn more about:

## [Speckle](https://speckle.guide/)

Organizations all over the world rely on our collaboration, interoperability and automation platform to deliver better buildings, faster. Speckle is a platform with endless possibilities, we'll walk you through some of its most common usage scenarios, but ultimately you'll have the flexibility to use Speckle (and your data) however you want.

What We'll Cover

This guide provides an introduction to the key Speckle concepts you'll need to know. We'll go over what you need to install, how to create an account, and how to send data to your first Speckle project.
We also have a few tutorials (opens new window)that provide step-by-step guidance for several common workflows (e.g. sending data Rhino -> Revit and back).
If you're a programmer wanting to learn how to build things with Speckle, head over to our developer docs. If you're after some in-depth reading on how Speckle works under the hood, make sure to check the core concepts section.

## [PowerBI](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/power-bi/)

Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data might be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

## [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

Not only does Codecademy have many great courses on various web development languages such as [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css), and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), but they even offer a course on [how to deploy a Jekyll site](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/deploy-a-website). If you are completely new to Jekyll, I would recommend working through that course as a great start for learning how to deploy your Jekyll site.
