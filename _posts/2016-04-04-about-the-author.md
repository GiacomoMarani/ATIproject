Exploring new ways to enrich the lives of the people who live in our buildings

«Architecture is the inspiration of everyday living. We seek a balance between the various disciplines, to give structure to creativity. This allows us to shape a single integrated project, which goes beyond particularities and is the spokesperson for our overall vision».

ATI Project is an international company specialized in integrated design in the field of architecture and engineering, committed to the development of sustainable buildings with reduced environmental impact.

The studio was established in 2011 by Branko Zrnic and Luca Serri, founders dedicated to research in the field of bioclimatic architecture and renewable energy. In twelve years, the team has grown from 2 to 350 collaborators, with an average age of 32.

The initial outline of the structure is the same that still drives its growth today: a young, visionary, technological studio that natively uses the BIM methodology to promote multidisciplinarity, as well as innovation and sustainability.

The complexity and number of projects reflect the international success of the office, which today, in addition to its headquarters in Pisa, has offices in Milan, Belgrade, Odense, Paris, Copenhagen, Geneva and Tallinn.
